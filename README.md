Creating New Cypress Project

# Make a new folder for Cypress Project exercises in your PC 
# Open the folder that your created inside Visual studio code 
# Open a terminal in VS code 
# Within the terminal execute the below command npm init -y 
# Package.json file will be created. This file will have all the dependencies added upon on successive installations. Similar to pom.xml in java projects 
# Install cypress with the command npm install cypress. This is will install the latest version of cypress in the same folder of VS code project folder 
# You can now verify in the package.json file with the dependencies section updated with Cypress 
# Verify the installed version 
  npx cypress -v 
  npx cypress verify 
# Based on the verification results you can confirm the cypress is working as expected 
# Open cypress with the command npx cypress open, then press enter. This will launch a new screen and that will be the launch Pad for all your Cypress test scripts.
